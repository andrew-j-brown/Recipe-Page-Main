## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was quite helpful for both practicing larger html and css files, as well as working with styling elements I am not as used to (such as tables). I also got to work with a (relatively simple) media query, which was fun.

### Continued development

I may development this further into a full recipe site, with page routing. This might be something to return to after picking up ReactJS and a simple backend.
